# Data Lake Architecture

This repository contains the infrastructure as code (IaC) and data processing pipelines for the enterprise data lake architecture.

## Project Overview

This project implements the data lake architecture described in the [Data Lake Architecture](../confluence_samples/02_data_lake_architecture.html) document.

## Related Jira Stories
- [DATA-501](../jira_stories/DATA-501.json): Implement data ingestion pipeline for e-commerce transactions
- [DATA-520](../jira_stories/DATA-520.json): Create data quality monitoring framework

## Architecture

The data lake architecture follows a multi-layer approach:

1. **Landing Zone (Raw Layer)**
   - Initial storage for raw data
   - Preserves original format and structure
   - Immutable storage for compliance and auditability

2. **Processing Zone (Bronze Layer)**
   - Data cleansing and validation
   - Schema enforcement
   - Data quality checks

3. **Enrichment Zone (Silver Layer)**
   - Data transformation and enrichment
   - Entity resolution and deduplication
   - Business rule application

4. **Consumption Zone (Gold Layer)**
   - Aggregated and denormalized views
   - Optimized for analytics and reporting
   - Exposed through data services

5. **Governance Layer**
   - Data catalog and metadata management
   - Access control and security
   - Data lineage tracking
   - Data quality monitoring

```

## Data Ingestion Pipelines

The repository includes several data ingestion pipelines:

1. **Batch Ingestion**
   - Scheduled data loads from operational databases
   - File-based ingestion from external sources
   - Historical data migration

2. **Real-time Ingestion**
   - Streaming data from web and mobile applications
   - IoT device data ingestion
   - Real-time transaction processing

3. **API-based Ingestion**
   - Third-party data integration
   - SaaS application data synchronization

## Data Quality Framework

The data quality framework provides:

- Rule-based data validation
- Data profiling and anomaly detection
- Quality metrics and dashboards
- Automated alerting for quality issues
- Data quality SLA monitoring

## Security and Governance

- Fine-grained access control with AWS Lake Formation
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- PII data detection and protection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data lineage tracking
